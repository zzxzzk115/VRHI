# Resource Management API

> **Note**: For the complete Chinese documentation, see [中文版](../zh-CN/api/resources.md)

## Overview

VRHI provides a unified resource management interface, including buffers, textures, samplers, and other GPU resources. All resources follow RAII principles for automatic lifecycle management.

## Buffer

Buffers are used for vertex data, index data, uniform data, and storage.

## Texture

Textures support 1D/2D/3D textures, cubemaps, and texture arrays with various formats.

## Sampler

Samplers control texture filtering and addressing modes.

## Shader

Shaders support GLSL, HLSL, and SPIR-V.
